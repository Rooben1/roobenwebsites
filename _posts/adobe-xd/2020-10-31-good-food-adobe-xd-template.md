What is Good Food?

“Good Food” is a FREE Adobe XD restaurant template.

Good food includes a menu template that you use on your next restaurant website design.

Aside from having a food menu it also includes a form and brand display template that you can take and customize to make your own.

More importantly this design has schematics to help you code this exact design in your web browser with HTML and CSS. 

## The features of this Adobe XD Template

<br/>

### Menu Templates, For Dish Display

Use these food menu templates to inspire your next food menu or restaurant designs.

Feel free to copy and paste these right into your design.
Remember that the aspect ratio for the images in the design is 16:9.

### Form Templates and Logo/Brand Display

This Adobe XD website example comes with an email form template and a brand showcase template.

You can take these and fill in the logos with some of the products that you have in stock.

### Schematics For Developers

Included in this template is a color guide to help developers with things like sizing, spacing, and grouping.

I came up with this idea because I got tired of clicking on elements and switch back and forth.

Instead I created this little schematic set up so I could just switch between the code editor and the adobe xd file a lot faster.

This Xd food template also comes with mobile app & tablet versions of the design. I found that the schematics for the mobile devices made it a lot easier to write the HTML & CSS for the responsive version of the design. 

### - Nunito Font

This templates uses "Nunito" the well balanced sans serif typeface. You can switch it on straight from the Adobe Website for FREE.
