### "I want a website, but I don't know what to put on it, can you help?"

Yes.

Starting a website is relatively easy, filling it with the information
that will attract customers is a little trickier.

If creating content for your website is your problem, I have a solutions.

I'll provide you with a list of questions about you and your business
that will help you get a good idea about what type of information your
website should contain.

For example:

- The types of products and services you offer?
- Your hours of operation?
- Simple or complex DIY tutorials/blog posts?

The answers you get from this list of questions should provide you with
piles of information about your business which we then can use to create
the content for your website.


**Consider this before you spend thousands of dollars on a custom website**

I often hear people talk about how they spent thousands of dollars making
a website only for to it not to get any traffic.  

Donâ€™t be that person.

Instead you should skip the high quality designs and graphics and focus
on the keywords you want to be found on Google for.

Don't get me wrong, a beautiful interface is a must for any serious website
owner.

But your not there yet, your focus should be on getting traffic to your
site first.
