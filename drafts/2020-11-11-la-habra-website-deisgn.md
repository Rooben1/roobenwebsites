Hello! I'm [Ruben Gutierrez](https://roobendesign.com/about) a website 
designer in [La Habra, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Habra,_California)

I can provide the best website design services for your project

I also provide my web design services in (Fullerton, Brea,
Rowland Heights, Anaheim, Whittier, Huntington & Newport Beach)

## Some common questions I get about my website design services

Down below I'll cover some of the services I provide through a Q&A.

If this Q&A doesn’t answer your question, feel free to contact me.
I’d like to hear more about your problem and how I may be able to
help out.

### Will I be able to post text, images, and videos on my website by myself?

Of course.

Part of building websites for my clients is actually teaching them how to
do basic things like

- Publish text, images, and videos
- Check contact form and other form submission 

A website you can’t make minor edits on can be useless and costly to maintain.

It'll eventually just turn into a burden rather than get you customers.

My goal is for your website to work consistently and for it to get you customers. 

### I need to add a tools/functionality to my website, do you do that also? 

Very much yes.

- Login Features
- Contac Forms / Forms (Contact, Applications,)
- Quote/Estimate Calculator
- Website Analytics 
- Action Buttons (Contact)
- Auto Respond to emails
- Appointment Scheduler
- Ecommerce/Online Shop
- Animations
- Weekly/Monthly Newsletter

I can do any of the above and more.

If your interested in any of the technology above I'd be happy to explain what
they do and if their the right fit for you.

If you think theirs a way to make your life easier don't hesitate to ask,
chances are theirs a technology available for automating some of the repetitive
tasks you have to do.

### Do you build websites for mobile devices too?

Yes sir/ma’am. 

[Google favors mobile websites](https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-first-indexing) 
more and more every year, this is because phones and other mobile devices
are doing the most searches.

Your website absolutely has to be built to include mobile devices.

Every website I put together is built with responsive design in mind.  I cover a large amount of mobile
devices during the development of your website so no need to worry.

### "I want to start selling my products online, can you build me an online store?"

Yes, depending on what and how much you sell we can find the best solutions for your online store.

Making a store is a multi step process that requires a lots of preparation. 

This might involve creating an order system that calculates prices with shipping cost or implementing 
a payment system and even adding reviews functions to your products to see what products you sell you're 
customers really like.

When you're ready I can help, This service can range all over the map so it's better that we discuss
your situations before I can give you a price.

Get started selling your products and services across the map!

### "What is the price of running a website?"

Aside from my services and what I charge, a basic website will cost you about
$5 - $10/month.  That includes the domain and the hosting service you choose.
I also offer a website service that would only cost you a $1/year in terms of
domain and server chargers.  

The $1 a year option doesn't come with the ability to edit and do all that fancy stuff like self editing but you'll have a website
that indestructible and doesn't need maitnencene.  This option is good if you just want something online without having to think about it
ever again, not something I recommend but it should get you some calls.
